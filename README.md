### Description

For this team project, we have created an interactive web application using Bootstrap as the front-end framework. The application will be deployed to GitHub Pages and will be responsive to different screen sizes.

The application will accept and respond to user input, making use of modals for user interaction instead of traditional alerts, confirms, or prompts. Client-side storage will be utilized to store persistent data, allowing for a better user experience.

We have utilized at least two server-side APIs to enhance the functionality of our application. A clean and well-structured repository is essential, adhering to quality coding standards, including proper file structure, naming conventions, and best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, and quality comments.

The application will have a polished user interface, ensuring an enjoyable experience for our users. Our README will include all relevant information, including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and a link to the deployed application.

### Installation

The intallation process consisted of:
```
